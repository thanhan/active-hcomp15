dec_seed100_no_ip.pkl: same as above but no interpolate

results_bo_ip : with backoff and interpolation

exp_cheap_expert : expert cost = 10


exp_cheap_expert : expert cost = 50

exp_proton_unf: uniform prior/eval_rel

exp_appendicitis_unf: same for appendicitis

idea: interpolation is important, responsible for the differneces
previous prior
still with crowd acc model

left: window = 10 better than 5, still worse than cde from 40k to 80k

middle: 0.99 decay, (look good)

right: appendicitis 0.99 : worse in the beginning
